####  I always wanted to make a website so thats exactly what I did. 
#### NameCheap offers students one free domain so I signed up and used my school email to rent [arshiakohanteb.me](http://arshiakohanteb.me) 
#### Then I used [Github Pages](pages.github.com) to host the website. 
#### The rest is just learning how to use html and that is one long self tought journey. 
#### So Join me for the ride!
